Joey's mushed up version of the taglist plugin

Adds a couple of modes with a tree-like layout, which is based rather naively
on the indentation of each tag's definition line in the file.  Works better in
some languages than others.



--- And some additional ctags rules ---

You are welcome to grab my tags for haskell, coffeescript, vimhelp, markdown:
