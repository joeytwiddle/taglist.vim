Joey's mushed up version of the taglist plugin

Adds a couple of modes which display tags in file-order, rather than grouped by
tag-type as in the original plugin.

You can cycle through the new and original display modes with 's'.

There are also new modes with a tree-like layout, which is based rather naively
on the indentation of each tag's definition line in the file.  This works
better in some languages than others.

I also made a bunch of changes *before* adding the new modes, but I can't
remember what they were!



--- And some additional ctags rules ---

You are welcome to grab my tags for haskell, coffeescript, vimhelp, markdown:

Note that you will also need the relevant tlist_*_settings for each language which can be found in:
